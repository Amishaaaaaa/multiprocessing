    "\n",

    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to run multiple processes concurrently, each having its own instance of the Python interpreter.\n",
    "It allows you to leverage multiple CPU cores or processors to perform parallel execution of tasks, thereby increasing the computational power and \n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why multiprocessing is useful in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Performance: By utilizing multiple processes, multiprocessing enables parallel execution of tasks. This can significantly speed up CPU-bound\n",
    "operations and computationally intensive tasks, as the workload is divided among different processes, effectively making use of all available CPU \n",
    "cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Responsiveness: Multiprocessing can enhance the responsiveness of an application by offloading time-consuming tasks to separate processes. \n",
    "This allows the main process to remain responsive and handle user interactions or other critical operations without being blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Parallelism: Python's multiprocessing module provides a high-level interface for creating and managing processes. It abstracts away the \n",
    "complexities of low-level process management, making it easier to introduce parallelism into your code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Execution Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: In multiprocessing, multiple processes are created, each with its own instance of the Python interpreter. These processes run \n",
    "independently and can execute tasks concurrently on different CPU cores or processors. Each process has its own memory space and resources, and\n",
    "communication between processes usually involves inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n",
    "Multithreading: In multithreading, multiple threads are created within a single process, sharing the same memory space and resources. Threads run\n",
    "concurrently and can perform tasks simultaneously, utilizing the available CPU time. Threads within the same process communicate through shared \n",
    "data structures and variables.\n",
    "CPU Utilization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing can fully utilize multiple CPU cores or processors by executing processes in parallel. Each process runs \n",
    "independently and can be scheduled on different cores, enabling true parallel execution and potentially improving overall performance for \n",
    "CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Multithreading: Multithreading can utilize multiple CPU cores to some extent, but due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, only one \n",
    "thread can execute Python bytecode at a time within a single process. This means that threads cannot achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks \n",
